I am Makers Academy graduate (January 2018) seeking my first Junior Developer role. I am looking for challenging work in an environment that will push me to improve my technical skills and grow as a software developer. Having completed an MRes in linguistics and cognitive sciences, I am pursuing a career change, through which I hope to marry my interests in natural language, cognition and formal logic with software engineering. As such I am particularly interested in development work involving natural language processing or machine learning.

## Skills and Strengths

### Technical:
- During my time at Makers Academy I have developed a technical skill-set for full stack software development, including:

Ruby, Rails
JavaScript, JQuery
RSpec, Jasmine

In addition to the course material, I have taken advantage of Makers' multilingual approach to pursue an interest in other programming languages, including C, Python and Clojure.

### Scientific and Analytical:

- Applied statistics (SPSS)
- Study Design and execution
- Linguistic analysis (grammatical, phonological, semantic (including formal logics)

#### Fast Learner:
I am driven by curiosity and pursuit of excellence, and have repeatedly demonstrated an ability to quickly master complex new information.
- Before starting at Makers Academy I had very little coding experience, but repeatedly pushed myself to undertake challenging technical projects during the course, including building a [blockchain](https://github.com/SuzanneHuldt/Building_a_Blockchain) and a a [game-playing bot](https://github.com/SuzanneHuldt/robot-wars) as a final project.
- During my year-long Masters degree, I learned, with no previous practical science experience, to design and execute a full psycho-linguistic study and conduct a statistical data analysis at a post-graduate level, for which I received distinction grades. Having chosen a research-focussed interdisciplinary track I was also able to gain a grounding in neuro-psychology and computer science topics in order to produce distinction grade post-graduate level work in these fields, some of which is being developed for publication.

### Collaborative Work:
- During my time at Makers Academy I have participated in several group projects. This, alongside learning to work within an Agile/XP framework, has pushed me to hone my team-working skills.
- I have strong communication skills, and am able to explain technical and abstract concepts with clarity to both colleagues and other with differing areas of expertise.
- I value the pursuit of deep understanding, both in my own work and in collaboration with others. During my final project work at Makers Academy I took care to ensure that each team member clarified their understanding of the concepts and technical implementation required to build each feature, and
- I am able to manage cooperation between disparate parties to implement a plan, for example to complete my masters thesis I had to coordinate between supervisors, ethics boards and local schools to set up an experimental study.

### Additional Skills and Experience
- I grew up native-level bilingual and in addition to English speak fluent Swedish (and can understand Norwegian and Danish). I also have good French and basic Hebrew, Amharic and German.
- I have strong writing skills, both in academic registers and for a general audience.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (October 2017 to January 2017)

Highly selective three month intensive software development course.

#### UCL (University of London) 2016-2017

- MRes Speech, Language and Cognition
- Distinction
- Interdisciplinary research masters combining linguistics, psychology and neuroscience. I also took the opportunity to study in the Department of Computer Science.
- My thesis presented original research investigating competing theories in child acquisition of exclusive and inclusive disjunction.

#### SOAS (University of London) 2012-2016

- BA Linguistics
- First Class

## Interests
- I love problem solving and spend a lot of my spare time with puzzles and crosswords. I am also passionate about detective fiction - especially the golden age classics. I enjoy reading about
ancient history and mythology and write a blog exploring the history of magical thought about writing and speech. I am on twitter [@SuzanneHuldt](https://twitter.com/SuzanneHuldt)
