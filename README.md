## Suzanne Huldt

I am a (soon to be!) junior developer from London who is fascinated by human-computer interaction involving natural language. 
Having pursued postgraduate education in linguistics and language science, I have decided to swtich gear and take the analytical skills and experience of working in collaborative environments and 
apply myself to building things, not just study them. I and am particularly interested in pursuing development jobs related to translation, automation, and natural language processing.  


## Skills

#### High Level Analytical Skills 

In my undergraduate and postgraduate education I have focussed on formal methods and have developed a high level of analytical ability. 

- I have taken and enjoyed undergraduate and postgraduate modules in formal logical methods (including propositional frameworks (deontic, alethic, temporal etc) as well as more complex formalisms. I am 
- competent with lambda calculus and have undertaken academic study of the fundamentals of functional programming. 
- 
- My masters dissertation (for which I received a strong distinction grade) focussed on child acquisition of disjunction 
- I have a good grounding in applied statistics and am trained in SPSS.


#### Independent Project Planning and Execution

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)


#### Collaborative Work 

- I am experienced in working to build projects as part of a team, both in leader-ship and non-leadership roles, including:
- 
- Collaborating closely with two supervisors, as well as schools, ethics departments and other administrative contacts while researching and writing my masters dissertation.
- As a postgraduate student I was invited to join a working group in the Department of Computer Science working on crypto-law and contract automation. As the only non-computer scientist
- in the room, I gained considerable experience in communicating ideas for action across different domains of technical expertise. 
- During my undergraduate degree I founded and served as president of the SOAS Queer Film society.
