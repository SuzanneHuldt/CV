## Suzanne Huldt

I am a (soon to be!) junior developer from London who is fascinated by human-computer interaction involving natural language. 
Having pursued postgraduate education in linguistics and language science, I have decided to swtich gear and move from studying to building. I am training at Makers Academy to 
develop the technical skills required to apply my linguistic knowledge and experience of working in collaborative interdisciplinary environments to industry projects.  
I and am particularly interested in pursuing development jobs related to translation, automation, and natural language processing.  


## Skills

#### High Level Analytical Skills 

In my undergraduate and postgraduate education I have focussed on formal methods and have developed a high level of analytical ability. 

 - I have taken and enjoyed undergraduate and postgraduate modules in formal logical methods (including propositional frameworks (deontic, alethic, temporal etc) as well as more complex formalisms. I am 
competent with lambda calculus and have undertaken academic study of the fundamentals of functional programming. 
 - My masters dissertation (for which I received a strong distinction grade) focussed on child acquisition of disjunction and invovled a considerable literature review concerning formal
 - semantic algebras, as well as original theoretical work employing formal description and set theoretical models. 
 - I have a good grounding in applied statistics and am trained in SPSS.


#### Collaborative Work 

I am experienced in working to build projects as part of a team, both in leader-ship and non-leadership roles.

 - As a postgraduate student I was invited to join a working group in the Department of Computer Science working on crypto-law and contract automation. As the only non-computer scientist
in the room, I gained considerable experience in communicating ideas for action across different domains of technical expertise. 
 - To plan my complete my masters dissertation project I had to collaborate closely with two supervisors, as well as schools, ethics departments and other administrative contacts.
- During my undergraduate degree I founded and served as president of the SOAS Queer Film society. 

#### Independent Project Planning and Execution

My academic experience has allowed me to develop strong skills in planning and executing projects and working independently to fulfill goals. In addition to postgraduate resarch, I chose
to undertake two dissertation projects during my undergraduate degree. 

#### Fast Learner

Having previously completed a BA and taken no science A-levels, I learned how to plan and execute a full scientific study from scratch during my masters, including all the requisite 
statistical and data handling skills. Having chosen a research-focussed interdisciplinary track I was also able to gain a grounding in neuro-psychology and computer science topics
in order to produce post-graduate level work in these fields. 


## Education

#### Makers Academy (October 2017 to January 2017)

I am currently studying at Makers Academy to develop my technical skills, currently focussing on Ruby. 

#### UCL (University of London) 2016-2017

- MRes Speech, Language and Cognition
- Distinction
- Interdisciplinary research masters combining linguistics, psychology and neuroscience. I also took the opportunity to study in the Department of Computer Science. 

#### SOAS (University of London) 2012-2016

- BA Linguistics
- First Class


## Additional Skills and Experience
- I grew up native-level bilingual and in addition to English speak fluent Swedish (and can understand Norwegian and Danish). I also have good French and basic Hebrew, Amharic and German. 
- I have strong writing skills, both in academic registers and for a general audience. 

## Hobbies and Interests
-I love problem solving and spend a lot of my spare time with puzzles and crosswords. I am also passionate about detective fiction - especially the golden age classics. I enjoy reading about
ancient history and mythology and write a blog exploring the history of magical thought about writing and speech. I am on twitter @SuzanneHuldt
